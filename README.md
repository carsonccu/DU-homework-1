# DU-homework-1 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor


## Description

In this assignment I was required to refactor code that was given to me to make it more accessable. When viewing the source code You should see semantic HTML elements are used in order to follow my code flow, and that they follow a logical structure. When looking at the source code there is alternate names to the images. All of my heading attributes fall in a sequential order and there is a clear concise title to my website. In this project I learned that your source code can become extremely difficult to follow without using html semantic elements. I also learned that your CSS style sheet needs to be organized as well and condensed in order to make it more clear to others reding your code.
